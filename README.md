# reimaginet

Visually grounded word and sentence representations

Reimaginet is the new version of [Imaginet](https://github.com/gchrupala/imaginet), 
which was originally introduced in [Chrupała et al 2015](http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.03694).

In this repository we are trying new models and features. 

## Pre-requisites

Reimaginet relies on [Theano](https://github.com/Theano/Theano) and [funktional](https://github.com/gchrupala/funktional). For training models on 
the MS-COCO dataset we currently rely on data from [Neuraltalk](https://github.com/karpathy/neuraltalk).
